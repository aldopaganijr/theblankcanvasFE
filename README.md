## Project Idea

We are making an online storefront for selling art prints, called "The Blank Canvas". We want people to be able to populate a cart and checkout from the store.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Sass
- MongoDb
- Express

## User Stories

- As a user, I would like to seemlessly navigate through collections of paintings
- As a user, I would like a quick and easy cart, and checkout process
- As a user, I would like to be able to read discriptions and outlooks of specific paintings *Stretch*
- As a user, I would like to save paintings that I like or hope to purchase in my own personal cart or saved list *Stretch*
- As a user, I would like to possibly look for specific paintings by name, possibly even type or catagory. *Stretch*
- As a user, I would like to be able to submit my own paintings for review and possible sale *Super Stretch* 


## MVP

- Build a functioning Art e-commerce app
- Front-end & Back-end are connected
- A working app with User-Friendly Navigation
- Have proper functioning routes that lead to desired location
- A pleasing aesthetic with a consistent theme throughout the entire app
- Have a responsive layout with consideration to product image quality
- Have an "About" page highlighting specific and notable details abut the store and items
- Have a "Contact" page so that users can contact with any questions or inquiries
- Have a "Shop" page that effectively renders all items seeded in the database
- Have a functioning cart that can successfully create, show, update, and delete items

## Stretch Goals
- A working navigation with a search function
- Have the contact form lead somewhere and/or return a confirmation to the user
- Have a functioning checkout process with possible payment processing 
- Cart and checkout animations
- Admin Page
- Have better social media inclusion
- Be able to store user data for current or future
- Make painting database descriptions more robust
- Possibly make individual painting pages.
