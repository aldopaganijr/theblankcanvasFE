## Project Idea

We are making an online storefront for selling art prints, called "The Blank Canvas". We want people to be able to populate a cart and checkout from the store.

## User Stories

- I am a retired architect. Having building my perfect house, it's time to fill out all of the empty walls!

- I never know what to purchase for gifts. Everyone loves an art print! I own several.

- As a user, I would like to seemlessly navigate through collections of paintings

- As a user, I would like to be able to read discriptions and outlooks of specific paintings

- As a user, I would like to save paintings that I like or hope to purchase in my own personal cart or saved list

- As a user, I would like a quick and easy cart, and checkout process

- As a user, I would like to possibly look for specific paintings by name, possibly even type or catagory.

- As a user, I would like to be able to submit my own paintings for review and possible sale *Super Stretch*
