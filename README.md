## Project Idea

We are making an online storefront for selling art prints, called "The Blank Canvas". We want people to be able to populate a cart and checkout from the store.

## User Stories

- I am a retired architect. Having building my perfect house, it's time to fill out all of the empty walls!

- I never know what to purchase for gifts. Everyone loves an art print! I own several.
